# K-Mean Clustering of Long Beach Patients with Heart Disease
## Overview
This project aimed to create a K-Mean Clustering to group anonymized data of patients who have been diagnosed with heart disease. This project utilized a dataset called [Heart_Disease_Cluster.csv](data/Heart_Disease_Cluster.csv), which contains information about patients with heart disease who are from Long Beach, LA. Based on inertia and silhouette scores, the patients were segmented into five groups, cluster 0 to 4. Subsequently, Decision Tree Classification was performed to identify distinct charateristics of each cluster, providing valuable insights for personalized treatment plans. [Overview of characteristics of each cluster can be found on Tableau Public.](https://public.tableau.com/views/HeartDiseasePortfolio/Story1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) 
## Circumstance Understanding
Heart disease has been the leading casue of death in US for over a century as highlighed by the [American Heart Association](https://newsroom.heart.org/news/more-than-half-of-u-s-adults-dont-know-heart-disease-is-leading-cause-of-death-despite-100-year-reign). Despite recent declines in mortality rates due to advances in diagonsis and treatment, heart disease remains a significant health threat. Therefore, by leveraging data-driven insights, we can uncover patterns and similarities among patients by grouping patients into distinct clusters based on their medical characteristics, enabling healthcare providers to tailor treatments to specific patients groups more effectively. For instance, one cluster may respond better to lifestyle changes, while another might benefit more from specific medications or surgical interventions. 
## Data Understanding
The data consisted of 303 patients and 12 features. The features included information on patients' ID, age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar >120mg/dl, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, and slope of the peak exercise ST segment. The bar graph below shows how many patients are in each of five clusters.
